# A Software Developer's Guide to Designing Better Software Apps: Key Strategies and Best Practices
The most fundamental problem in computer science is how to take a complex problem and divide it up into pieces that can be solved independently. 

This is a central design task that Software Developers face every day, and the success of software applications depends on the careful application of design principles that prioritize efficiency, maintainability, and user satisfaction.

In this talk, I'll explore key design principles that can guide developers in creating better software solutions, like modular design and abstraction, tactical vs. strategic programming, complexity & consistency of software design, defining errors, designing for performance, modifying existing code, exception handling as well as things like documenting software and writing better comments.
